# Desk to Defender Website

## Getting Started

Just run the usual commands and peep the `package.json` file to see the available scripts and packages.

For the lazy:

- `yarn` to build that big ol' `node_modules` folder
- `yarn start` to boot up that dev server and start building
- `yarn build` when you're ready to build a production bundle

**Bonus**
`yarn build && npx serve docs` will boot up a local server of your production site!
